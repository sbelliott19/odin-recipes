# odin-recipes
First project assignment for The Odin Project

This assignment is asking me to create a simple webpage for 3 recipe links.  I chose a carrot cake recipe that requires two other recipes to be prepared in order to finish it.  I will be practicing with several HTML tags such as anchor and list tags.  I will also be including serveral links (anchors) throughout the main recipe at points where the other recipes are referenced.
