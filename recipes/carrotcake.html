        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is such a great recipe!  A few years ago, my lovely wife challenged
        me to a cake baking contest.  She allowed me to choose the cake flavor, and
        I couldn't just pick an easy one.  Carrot cake typically has quite a bit going
        on, and this recipe is no exception.</p>
        <p>To replicate the full profile of the flavor, <em>do not skip the <a 
        href="./buttermilkglaze.html">Buttermilk Glaze!</a></em></p>
        <p>Note: If you prefer less sweet, the taste is still amazing if you use only
        one cup of sugar here.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. table salt</li>

        <p>Also, <em>don't forget the most important ingredient</em>...<strong>
        Love!</strong></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with parchment 
            paper; lightly grease and flour parchment paper. Set pans aside.</li>
            <li>Stir together first 4 ingredients—flour, baking soda, salt, and 
            cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs and next 4 ingredients at medium speed with an electric mixer 
            until smooth. Add flour mixture, beating at low speed until blended. Fold 
            in carrot and next 3 ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350°F for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in 
            center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Drizzle <a href="./buttermilkglaze.html">Buttermilk Glaze</a> evenly over 
            layers; cool in pans on wire racks 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from pans, and cool completely on wire racks.</li>
            <li>Spread <a href="./creamcheesefrosting.html">Cream Cheese Frosting</a> 
            between layers and on top and sides of cake.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Oh, and of course the best step of all, <em>slice and enjoy!</em></p>
